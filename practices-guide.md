# Practices Guide

> If you havenâ€™t yet explored our [Coding Guide](.//coding-guide.md), I strongly encourage you to take a look. It lays the groundwork for writing robust, consistent, and maintainable Node.js code.

## Overview

This document highlights the engineering practices that make our applications scalable, efficient, and aligned with industry standards. These practices ensure high-quality code and seamless collaboration.

## Core Practices

### **API Development**
- We use [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for building REST APIs, with middleware for essential tasks such as:
  - **Logging**: Centralized and structured using tools like [Pino](https://getpino.io/).
  - **Request Parsing**: Efficient body parsing with `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`.

### **Real-Time Communication**
- We leverage [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for real-time features, backed by:
  - **Redis Adapter**: For horizontal scalability and distributed event handling.

### **Containerization**
- Each microservice, backend, and frontend runs in isolated containers:
  - Ensures consistency across environments.
  - Supports deployment on platforms like Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or AWS ECS.

### **Backend for Frontend (BFF)**
- We follow the **BFF pattern**, ensuring dedicated backends cater to the specific needs of each frontend.

### **Schema Validation**
- All incoming and outgoing requests are validated using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) and [ajv](https://ajv.js.org/).
- Prevents invalid data from propagating through the system.

### **Code Structure**
- We adopt a hybrid approach:
  - **Functional**: For smaller, stateless logic.
  - **Class-Based**: For scalable and reusable controllers and services.

## Database Practices

### **Database Management**
- We use [Sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/) for database interactions, with:
  - **Master-Slave Architecture**: Distributes read/write operations across nodes for better performance.

### **Transactions**
- Every database mutation is wrapped in transactions to maintain atomicity. Any failure or validation error triggers a rollback.

### **Locks for Consistency**
- Critical resources, such as user wallets, are secured with database locks to avoid race conditions.

## Robustness and Scalability

### **Error Handling**
- Centralized error-handling middleware ensures consistent error responses.
- Use meaningful error codes and descriptive messages for debugging.

### **Asynchronous Operations**
- Prefer `async/await` syntax for clarity and simplicity.
- Wrap asynchronous blocks with `try/catch` for proper error handling.

### **Logging**
- Comprehensive logging of all application events:
  - Structured formats for better parsing and visualization.
  - Use [Pino](https://getpino.io/) for performance and scalability.

## Security Practices

### **Environment Variables**
- Managed via `.env` files and loaded using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
- Sensitive configurations are never hardcoded.

### **Validation and Sanitization**
- Input data is rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent attacks like SQL injection and XSS.
- Use libraries like [validator.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) for additional checks.

### **Authentication**
- Support secure authentication mechanisms such as JWT with refresh tokens.
- Store passwords using bcrypt with sufficient salt rounds.

---

## Development Best Practices

### **CI/CD Pipelines**
- Automate testing, linting, and deployments using CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.

### **Testing**
- Write unit and integration tests using:
  - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for backend code.
  - Mocking tools like [Sinon.js](https://sinonjs.org/) for dependencies.
- Aim for high test coverage, with critical flows tested end-to-end.

### **Documentation**
- Code documentation is maintained with [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/).
- API endpoints are documented using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

---

## Optimization Practices

### **Performance**
- Optimize queries and reduce N+1 problems by eager loading in Sequelize.
- Cache frequently accessed data using [Redis](https://redis.io/).

### **Resource Management**
- Manage memory and CPU usage by properly handling resource-intensive operations, such as file uploads and streaming.

### **Build Optimization**
- Use tools like Webpack or Rollup for optimized builds in production.
- Leverage tree-shaking to eliminate unused code.

---

## Team Collaboration

### **Version Control**
- Follow Git best practices:
  - Use meaningful commit messages.
  - Organize branches logically (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `release/`).
  - Regularly review and clean stale branches.

### **Code Reviews**
- Enforce peer code reviews for every PR to ensure quality and shared understanding.
- Use linters and formatters like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce consistency.

Adhering to these practices will keep our codebase clean, scalable, and future-proof while promoting a culture of quality and collaboration.
